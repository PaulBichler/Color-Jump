## About the Multiplayer Game Mode

In Color Jump, you play in a team of 2, one Red and one Blue character. Characters can only collide with platforms of their color or white platforms. Some platforms change their color to the color of the character that collides with them. The goal of Color Jump is for your team to complete the obstacle course and reach the end platform before any other team. The level features some tricky puzzles that require you and your team mate to carefully think about your moves. Made a wrong move? Jumping out of the play field resets the puzzle for both players. Don't worry, there's a checkpoint after each puzzle that is activated when both players stand on it (it turns green if it's activated).

Happy Jumping!

Multiplayer Distributed Programming CA1 submission.

## About the Game

Our CA1 submission game is inspired by the game "Date Night" by Brackeys (https://brackeysgames.itch.io/date-night).
In this 2-player puzzle platformer game, player 1 controls a red character and player 2 a blue character. The goal of the game is for both players to reach the finish platform. The catch is that player 1 (the red character) can only collide with Red Plaforms and player 2 (the blue character) only with blue ones. The game also features Impact platforms that change the color of the platform to the color of the player colliding with it. Other elements like spikes and Pulse platforms offer a variety of additional challanges.
The game features a total of 9 levels with increasing difficulty.
